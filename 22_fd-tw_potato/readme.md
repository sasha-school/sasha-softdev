# DISCO
###tailwind
- tailwind is super customizable, especially for colours, fonts, backgrounds etc which could be modified in one line
- very aesthetically pleasing -- easy to add rounded corners to boxes and buttons
- easy to toggle light/darkmode
- padding is simple to customize, many attributes in every class
- the way that colours can be selected is very nice too, better than manually making colour palletes of hex codes

# QCC
###tailwind
- are there prebuilt components? is it academically honest to access them? very customizable but might be hard to build many new concepts from scratch
